<body>
  <p>My name is Karlo Mangubat and I currently reside in Yokosuka, Japan. I got my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from
    Jacksonville University, FL. Afterwards, I graduated Officer Candidate School in Newport, RI and was assigned to USS
    STETHEM (DDG 63) to serve as a Main Propulsion Officer. I separated from the Navy and now I work as a contractor as
    a Supply Technician for Yoksosuka Ship Repair Facility.
    <br><br>
    I did a little bit of coding while pursuing my degree. I have experience in C# and LaTeX.
    <br><br>
    My hobbies include playing video games, working out, and traveling to different countries. What I hope to gain in
    this class is to meet a lot of people and gain more experience in the tech world.</p>
